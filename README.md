# Hi there!

I'm a delivery lead/manager in larger Tech Consulting company where I support my clients in implementing, renewing and cloudifcation of their engineerign platforms, mainly focussing on product Liefecycle Management (PLM) systems as core of engineering.
This is my private GitHub account without direct relation to my daily work.

My interests are
- C/C++ development, recently started with embedded systems
- Python development (as it is the easiest way to get into AI development)
- 3D printing

Successfully finished the UDACITY Robotics Software Engineer ND Program.
